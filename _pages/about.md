At present I'm a software developer / site reliability engineer at Google, based in Munich.

Tl;dr:

* I grew up in Israel & California.
* MSc in Computer Science from Oxford; BSc in Physics and Computer Science from the Technion (Israel).
* Besides my interest in tech & science, I also love reading biographies, hiking & bouldering.
* My name in Hebrew means "my song". Considering my complete lack of musical talent, this is somewhat ironic. Nonetheless, I appreciate the thoughtfulness my parents put into choosing my name.

My resume is available [here]({% link /assets/resume.pdf %}).
