Hi there!

Tl;dr:

- I'm a software developer / site reliability engineer, based in Israel. Ex-Google, currently exploring opportunities, with the aspiration to make a positive impact.
- I grew up in Israel & California, and I've also lived in Germany, Italy, England and China. I love living in cultures different from mine, and have come to realize over the years that my concept of 'home' is very different from that of most people I know.
- I have an MSc in Computer Science from Oxford, and a BSc in Physics and Computer Science from the Technion (Israel). These days I don't delve into physics nearly as much as I'd like, but I hope to make more time for this someday.
- Besides my interests in tech & science, I also love reading biographies and other non-fiction works. I've recently spent quite some time reading about 20th century Germany.
- My name in Hebrew means "my song". Considering my complete lack of musical talent, this is somewhat ironic. Nonetheless, I appreciate the thoughtfulness my parents put into choosing my name.

My resume is available [here]({% link /assets/resume.pdf %}).
