"Sure, go ahead and use Wix! It's cheaper than me, but it has its limits. If you outgrow it, give me a call."


## Wordpress

Wordpress is not for those who know nothing about web development and want to frequently update their site themselves. For those people website builders are a great solution which gives them a lot of freedom and control, without spending tons of money, all the while being more than enough for their needs.

If you do want to do online scheduling, DONT use the wix booking platform. Use a third party booking service so in case you ever need to move away from wix you can take your booking platform with you. I recommend using square up for your payment processing and get their booking platform when you need it and just add a link to your site. Nice and easy. I never make custom booking solutions. You become vendor locked in the ecosystem your site is made in and can’t leave it without starting over with your booking system. So keep your site and your booking and online ordering separate.

Squarespace also controls the design system more, and is less flexible which I think is actually a plus if you don't have a background in design. With too much flexibility your website can quickly become unprofessional looking, with a chaotic color palette & font sizing, and random features where they're not needed.

I just prefer square space over wix since wix gives more freedom. It’s easier to make bad design decisions on wix than square space.

Coming here to say that I was in a similar boat years ago: I went with WordPress, but over the years as my site grew, my services and plug-ins became less dependable. It became a frankenstein's monster situation with things cobbled together and breaking separately over time.
