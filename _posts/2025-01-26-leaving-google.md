After spending four years at Google, it was time to move on. In this post, I'll share why I decided to leave Google - a company that Iâ€™m grateful to have been a part of - and what I'm looking for next.

## Google is a Wonderful Yet Slow Place

Google is an extraordinarily kind place to work at. I met so many talented, skilled, and intelligent people. I received exceptional mentorship from my managers and senior developers, enjoyed the well-known perks (free meals & gym access) and had the flexibility to hop between different teams. Google is a fantastic environment to kickstart a career and gain experience with the the tech industry.

Despite these benefits, it was time for me to move on.

Google today isn't the same company it once was. With over [180,000](https://seo.ai/blog/how-many-people-work-at-google#:~:text=Google's%20employee%20count%20stands%20at,the%20previous%20count%20of%20182%2C381.) employees as of January 2025, it often feels more like a sprawling bureaucracy than an agile, innovative company. Here are a few illustrative examples:

- **Cross-team collaboration challenges**: Your team and another team want to collaborate, but each team belongs to a different hierarchy ladder and reports to a different VP. The two VPs don't get along and have different visions. Even though your team and the other team really collaborate and the Tech Leads and managers agree it would be beneficial, it takes months to get approval and deal with red tape.

- **Severely uneven resource distribution**: Your team is underfunded and desparately needs more developers, yet one of your sister teams is overfunded, with developers there having way too much free time on their hand. Tthe developers on the sister team confirm this is the case and that you're not imagining. The skip-manager keeps starving your team and buffing the other team for some unknown reason - a classic case of higher level politics.

- **Lack of accountability**: Your team makes a promise to deliver Product X or Feature Y by date Z, but the timeline comes and goes without consequences. Since ad revenue continues to flow in from some distance corner of Google, there aren't repercussions to missed deadlines, and the underlying issues that cause the missed deadline don't get properly addressed.

- **Constant shifting of priorities**: VPs frequently change their priorities without clear rationale, so projects are started, shuffled, and halted frequently. This is demotivating and frustrating for developers, and leads to lower morale, creativity, and tangible progress.

Ultimately, working at Google sometimes felt like running on a very advanced treadmill. The treadmill is exciting and offers an assortment of cool functions, but I'd rather run on wilder terrain.

## What's Next?

I'm eager to work on something that truly helps people. Ideally, I'd love to be part of an organization that is:

- focused on making a positive impact
- laser-focused on its goals
- agile enough to pivot when necessary but not randomly so
- attentive and responsive to user feedback
- small to medium sized

I'm excited to start brainstorming and connecting with like-minded, passionate individuals and organizations. If you know of any opportunities or have suggestions, please reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avni-shiri/).
