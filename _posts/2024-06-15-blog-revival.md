It's amazing how time flies. The last time I posted on an earlier version of this blog was in August 2020, shortly after I was accepted to Google. Fast forward nearly 4 years, 3 teams, and 1 continent later, and the itch to restore my blog has returned.

## Content Updates

I didn't migrate all my old posts - most of the book reviews, math/physics musings, and miscellaneous toying with Python didn't make the cut. I also had an old post about the reactions to my cutting my hair short! I enjoyed re-reading it, but didn't bother to port it over. The tl;dr for that one is that in many ways Israel is still quite conservative, and the response to my short hair was (and continues to be) surprisingly strong there.

I left the old Oxford & Google application posts, as I still get asked quite frequently about that.

What's next? Going forward, I plan to write more about my learnings coding at Google and to dabble in some open source projects.

## Infrastructure Changes

Back in 2018 I used Jekyll & Markdown files for my blog. I had hosted it on Heroku and used Google Domains for my site domain. I didn't use any proper templates, and had been frustrated with how non-mobile friendly my website was.

### ~~Trying Out Wordpress~~

Now, in 2024, I decided to try to avoid the UI pain and check out Wordpress. It took me exactly 2 hours to realize that was a mistake. I had tried the 80$ annual subscription to Wordpress, knowing it was refundable for the first 2 weeks. 

I started porting my blog posts over, and quickly came across one that included mathematical expressions. Lo and behold - to have support for math expressions, I would need some math plugin. But plugins aren't supported with the 80$ subscription, and I would need to jump to the $300 subscription just to add that plugin. I don't have a problem paying for good services, but paying for mathematical scripts seemed way below the bar.

I also quickly realized that porting content out of Wordpress if I wanted to change platform in the future would also be a pain (although there does seem to be a plugin for that!).

I also didn't like that adding tags/categories was post-by-post manual. I missed the ability to tweak layouts already.

### GitHub Pages & Remote Themes

I decided to go back to Jekyll, prefering the UI pain points over all the ones in Wordpress. I needed to refresh my memory on Jekyll, but luckily it's quite an intuitive generator. It was also cool to see that Github pages could host my blog for free, and that I could easily use remote themes, saving me a lot of the UI hassle.

I decided to use the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. The downside is that it's less obvious for me at the moment how to change the layouts for all my posts at once (the theme does a lot work behind the scenes). I can also see that the mobile pages aren't completely sleek, although it's a lot better than what I would have done myself.

All in all, a good compromise on quality vs time.

### Domain Registration

Unsurprisingly, Google Domains is no longer available (see https://killedbygoogle.com/ if you haven't already!). I went for Squarespace this time!
