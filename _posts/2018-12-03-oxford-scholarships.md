Studying at Oxford is expensive, but there are many scholarships available for MSc students. With thoughtful planning, you have a strong chance of securing at least some funding. In fact, after weighing my options between Cambridge and Oxford, the availability of scholarships was a key factor in my decision to apply solely to Oxford—Cambridge appeared to offer significantly fewer funding opportunities for MSc students.

# Uni Scholarships vs College Scholarships

If you've read my previous post about Oxford, you may already know that there is a surprising distinction between Oxford University and its individual colleges. Because of this unique structure, you should apply for both university-sponsored and college-specific scholarships. This was something that I, like many of my fellow international students, did not fully grasp before arriving at Oxford.

For a comprehensive list of university scholarships, see this [portal](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/fees-and-funding/fees-funding-and-scholarship-search/scholarships-a-z-listing). Although the university search engine is supposed to list all the college-specific scholarships as well, I have found that this is not always the case. For instance, I've found listings of scholarships specific to the 'New College' college that do not appear in the university search engine results. (Fun fact: 'New College' was named as such because it was considered new when it was founded in 1386!)

My general recommendation is to first explore all the scholarship options listed in the university portal linked above. After that, start researching the scholarship options of each of the colleges (beginning with the wealthiest ones), by searching for their scholarships online individually.

# WHT Scholarship

While at Oxford, I had the immense privilege of being fully funded by the Weidenfeld-Hoffman Trust (WHT) Scholarship. This scholarship is designed for one-year MSc students from across the globe, supporting approximately 30 students annually.

The WHT scholarship staff were incredibly kind, generous, and supportive, and they made my year at Oxford so much more memorable. One of the highlights was a multi-day pre-year seminar on leadership and ethics Throughout the year, WHT staff organized additional leadership sessions and fun activities for us, such as going on a tour of Parliament and ice-skating in London over Christmas.

What I believe distinguishes this scholarship from others like the Rhodes Scholarship, is its intimacy and multiculturalism. With a limit of 3 scholars from any single country each year, it prevents the formation of country-specific cliques and ensures a diverse range of perspectives.

The trust was established by George Weidenfeld (1919-2016), who led an inspiring life despite his difficult youth. Lord Weidenfeld fled Austria in 1938 and relocated to the UK, where he rebuilt his life from the ground up. The trust also receives support from Michael Lewis and André Hoffmann.
