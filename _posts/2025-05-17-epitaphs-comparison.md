As I detailed in my [previous post](https://www.shiriavni.org/google/2025/04/19/developing-epitaphs.html), a friend and I are currently developing a [website](https://epitaphs.pages.dev/) as a side project. The site we're developing lets you write farewell letters that will be shared with your loved ones after your death. I thought it would be useful to compare our website to other services, to see how the site stacks up.

## Comparisons & Thoughts

First off, I'll say that [My Future Message](https://mygoodtrust.com/future-message) seems like the clear winner. It has a lot of neat features and has a great GUI.

Our site does stand out in terms of the writing experience, offering a clean WYSIWYG editor (based on Facebook's [Lexical](https://lexical.dev/)) with custom fonts, colors, and media uploads including images and embedding video links (though weâ€™re still ironing out a few bugs).

Our site is running on a serverless architecture, which causes loading spinners to appear briefly on initial load. We'll need to work on that.

Other platforms offer additional features that we lack: some have dedicated mobile apps, others allow you to schedule multiple messages to be sent at specific times after your passing. I also appreciate that the [MyWishes](https://www.mywishes.co.uk/) site includes message templates to help users get started.

A few of the services that I tested felt buggy or unreliable.

## Bottom Line

Given that [My Future Message](https://mygoodtrust.com/future-message) is a neat and ready product, I think our most meaningful contribution would be to open-source our project and focus on making it stable and trustworthy for anyone who wants to use it. An added bonus of open sourcing this project is that there will be less pressure on my friend and I to maintain the site entirely ourselves.
