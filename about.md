Hi there!

I'm a software developer / site reliability engineer, based in Israel. **Ex-Google**, currently exploring opportunities with the aspiration to make a positive impact.

- I have an **MSc in Computer Science** from Oxford, and a **BSc in Physics and Computer Science** from the Technion (Israel). These days I don't delve into physics nearly as much as I'd like though!
- I grew up in **Israel & California**, and I've also lived in Germany, Italy, England and China. I love living in cultures different from mine, and now realize that my concept of 'home' is very different from that of most people I know.
- Besides my interests in tech & science, I also love reading **biographies** and other non-fiction works. I've recently spent quite some time reading about 20th century Germany.
- My name in Hebrew means _**my song**_. Considering my complete lack of musical talent, this is somewhat ironic. Nonetheless, I appreciate the thoughtfulness my parents put into choosing my name.

My resume is available [here]({% link /assets/resume.pdf %}).
